# Mini-Project-
Leaf disease detection using CNN

Leaf disease detection using CNNs is an innovative application of machine learning and computer vision to address the challenges of plant disease identification and management. This project aims to develop a robust and accurate system for identifying diseases in plant leaves by analyzing images of the leaves.
 Some tools and technologies used in this :
 
 Python: The primary programming language used in machine learning and deep learning projects.

kaggle : It hosts a vast collection of datasets across various domains. These datasets can be used for practice, research, and competitions. Users can upload and share datasets as well.

TensorFlow: An open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. TensorFlow provides a high-level API, Keras, which simplifies the creation of CNN models.

Pandas: A data manipulation library for data preprocessing and analysis. It's useful for tasks like reading and manipulating datasets.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization, which are helpful for visualizing image data, performance metrics, and results.

NumPy: A fundamental library for numerical operations in Python. It's used for array manipulation and mathematical operations.
